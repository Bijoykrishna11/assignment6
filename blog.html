        <h4>1.Var, Let, and Const – What's the Difference?</h4>

        <p>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.var variables
            can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const
            variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.</p>

        <h4>2.What is the difference between arrow function and regular function?</h4>

        <p>Arguments objects are not available in arrow functions, but are available in regular functions. Regular
            functions created using function declarations or expressions are ‘constructible’ and ‘callable’. Since
            regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the ‘new’ keyword.</p>

        <h4>3.Why we use Template Strings?</h4>

        <p>We use templat string because the string templating (or string interpolation) feature is ubiquitous in many
            programming languages. You should use it when you have a distinct or recurring template that you wish to
            fill in with the variables in current scope. It makes the template more readable than concatenation of
            strings or printf-style formatting.</p>
